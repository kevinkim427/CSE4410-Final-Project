We created a game based on Dark Souls. The executable game is under the "Game" folder.
Implementing a small map, with 2 enemies, and one boss at the end.
There is an Interactbale FogWall that blocks the player form the boss arena, once entered the fog wall blocks the player from escaping the boss room,
and passing the fog wall initializes the boss fight.
Player can lock on to enemies using the "f" key, can sprint by holding left shift key, roll by tapping the left shift key.
The player can attack using 'e' and 'r' keys.
